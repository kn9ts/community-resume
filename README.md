# Community Resume for Eugene Mutai

## Revived Nairobi JavaScript Community
Date: **Feb 12th 2015**

The Nairobi JavaScript Community had been created, last year and had died down towards the end of the same year.

It is now the most active community in the city if not in Kenya, and growing by the day. Other milestones achieved for the JavaScript Community are:

#### Creation of a Whatsapp Group
Currently at **95** members (threshold is 100 for whatsapp groups)

#### Meetup Group page & mailing list
Link: [http://meetup.com/nairobi-js](http://meetup.com/nairobi-js)

Currently at **202** (at the time of writting) which would serve great in sharing updates to the community at large and also keep them updated on details and date of the next schedules meetups

#### Refurbishing of Nairobi JS Community Site

## Frodo [Go Web Framework]

Started: **6th July, 2015**

Link: [Frodo Github Repo](https://github.com/kn9ts/frodo)

Frodo is a Go mini web framework inspired by the sweet/beautiful parts that make up Laravel(php), Slim (php) and ExpressJS(node.js).
