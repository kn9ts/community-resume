## Reason for applying
I am forever passionate about programming, specifically on web technologies. One main reason that fuels this passion has forever changed my life since the day I chose this path and I want to share what passion does to you, how far it takes you, in viewing and tackling issues, seeing barriers as an advantage to learning new ways of forever overcoming lesser, greater or equal like barriers.

Am also passionate about the community by understanding that one man alone can not create the future we seek. That unity is strength and divided we fall. That together we have the power to shape the technological future, for ourselves and the next of generations, and that this is a radial impact to us, and everyone around us. I also feel great mentoring/shaping the community, encouraging others to join, the journey, and helping them so that what I do trickles down from them to others and so forth.

## Relationship with Google
Yes, with **GDG** leads and school ambassadors. The relationship is still young and in progress. Why I want to do this is to mentor, foster the growth of web technologies and help in demystifying it for all who love and are the enthusiast with web technologies yet have little or no exposure to its development or existence over the decades it has been around. One reason for them being on the blind side is that the school's syllabus is old and broken, if I might say so, with nothing about web technologies or advancements.

## Created Nairobi JavaScript Community Slack Group
Date Created: **3rd July, 2015**

Link: [https://nairobijs.slack.com/](https://nairobijs.slack.com/)

Due to the whatsapp group limitation to 100 members we further decided a **Slack** group would serve as well as wanted all members to be able to share, communicate and fun together without the 100 members limitation imposed on whatsapp groups.

This way could also seperate discussions into topics of interest. This would seperate noise from the important information that is shared where members desired to retain them. **72** members joined up within the 1st week. Currently at **106** members at the time of writting this.

To make life easier for new members to join, I went ahead to automate the process using [slackin](http://rauchg.com/slackin/). Also shows how many users are online.
