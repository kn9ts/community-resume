# Community Resume for Eugene Mutai

## Revived Nairobi JavaScript Community
When: **Feb 12th 2015**

The Nairobi JavaScript Community had been created, last year and had died down also in the same year towards the end of the same year.

It is now the most active community in the city if not in Kenya. And growing by the day. Other milestones achieved for the JavaScript Community are:

#### Creation of a Whatsapp Group
Currently at **95** members (threshold is 100 for whatsapp groups)

#### Meetup Group page & mailing list
Link: [http://meetup.com/nairobi-js](http://meetup.com/nairobi-js)

Currently at **202** (at the time of writting) which would serve great in sharing updates to the community at large and also keep them updated on details and date of the next schedules meetups

This was a workshop to help guys to learn how to build AngularJS powered applications by building your 1st AngularJS app also learning the fundermentals of Angular. AngularJS has a fair share of deep concepts; taking some time to understand them can get you back on track.

## Frodo [Go Web Framework]

Link: [Frodo Github Repo](https://github.com/kn9ts/frodo)

Frodo is a Go mini web framework inspired by the sweet/beautiful parts that make up Laravel(php), Slim (php) and ExpressJS(node.js). I have inspired a couple members of the community, and also inviting them to join and contribute what might be the 1st Go web app framework in Go built in Africa.
