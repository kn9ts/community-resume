# Community Resume for Eugene Mutai

## Revived Nairobi JavaScript Community
When: **Feb 12th 2015**

The Nairobi JavaScript Community had been created, last year and had died down also in the same year towards the end of the same year.

It is now the most active community in the city if not in Kenya. And growing by the day. Other milestones achieved for the community are:

#### Opened up a Whatsapp Group
Currently at **95** members (threshold is 100)

#### Meetup Group page & mailing list
Link: [http://meetup.com/nairobi-js](http://meetup.com/nairobi-js)

Currently at **202** (at the time of writting) which would serve great in sharing updates to the community at large and also keep them updated on details and date of the next schedules meetups

#### Refurbished Nairobi JS Community Site

## Start to Grunt boilerplate
[http://kn9ts.github.io/start-to-grunt/](http://kn9ts.github.io/start-to-grunt/)

Created on: **Mar 22, 2015**

Created HTML5 starter kit for creating HTML5 application and user interfaces, with **GruntJS**
integration for fast, clean and optimized app creation. Would serve the developer community to be able to come
up to par with **GruntJS** intergration with their projects.

## JavaScript is Back
Held on: **March 21 · 2:00 PM**

Attendance: **30 Community Members**

This was the 1st meetup this year, signifying the revival of the group. Members showed up and were to state what they would expect along the year in our meetups. They also stated their issues and restaints and also how we could come together to solve common issues and restaints among the members as the year grows old.

## Shaping up with AngularJS
Meetup held on: **May 2 · 1:30 PM**

Attendance: **33**

**Details:**

This was a workshop to help guys to learn how to build AngularJS powered applications by building your 1st AngularJS app also learning the fundermentals of Angular. AngularJS has a fair share of deep concepts; taking some time to understand them can get you back on track.

## Start to Gulp boilerplate
[https://github.com/kn9ts/start-to-gulp](https://github.com/kn9ts/start-to-gulp)

Created and shared on: **Jul 24, 2015**

A **GulpJS** alternative to the **GruntJS** Boilerplate I had created for those who would prefer **Gulp** rather than
**GruntJS** which was percieved a bit harder
