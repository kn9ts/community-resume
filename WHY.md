### Reason for applying
I am forever passionate about programming, specifically on web technologies. One main reason that fuels this passion is has forever changed my life since the day I chose this path and I want to share what passion does to you, how far it takes you, in viewing and tackling issues, seeing barriers as an advantage to learn ways of forever overcoming equal like barriers.

Am also passionate about the community by understanding that one man alone can not create the future we seek. That unity is strength and divided we fall. That together we have the power to shape the technological future, for ourselves and the next of generations, and that this is a radial impact to the us, and the everyone around us. I also feel great mentoring/shaping the community for this, encouraging others to join, the journey, helping them so that also what I do trickles down from them to others and so forth.

### Relationship with Google
Yes, with GDG leads and school ambassadors, still young and in progress. Why I want to do this is to mentor, foster the growth of web technologies and help in demistyfying it for all who love and are enthusiast with web technologies.
