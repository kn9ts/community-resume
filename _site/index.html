<p>Link: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prittyapp">PrittyNote(Play Store)</a></p>

<p>PrittyNote makes digital images that would be the average size of a sticky note in real life and way much more cool. At PrittyNote we call the images “prittynote(s)”. Perceive real sticky notes that you’ve written a joke, advice, quote, lovely message, or anything and left somewhere a friend, relative, family or people can see. With prittynote you can share to any social platform e.g. Whatsapp, facebook, twitter, tumblr, instagram etc.</p>

<h2 id="shaping-up-with-angularjs">Shaping up with AngularJS</h2>
<p>Held on: <strong>May 2, 2015</strong></p>

<p>Meetup Link: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nairobi-js/events/221932763/">http://www.meetup.com/nairobi-js/events/221932763/</a></p>

<h2 id="created-nairobi-javascript-community-slack-group">Created Nairobi JavaScript Community Slack Group</h2>
<p>Date Created: <strong>3rd July, 2015</strong></p>

<p>Link: <a href="https://nairobijs.slack.com/">https://nairobijs.slack.com/</a></p>

<p>Due to the whatsapp group limitation to 100 members we further decided a <strong>Slack</strong> group would serve as well as wanted all members to be able to share, communicate and fun together without the 100 members limitation imposed on whatsapp groups.</p>

<p>This way could also seperate discussions into topics of interest. This would seperate noise from the important information that is shared where members desired to retain them. <strong>72</strong> members joined up within the 1st week. Currently at <strong>106</strong> members at the time of writting this.</p>

<p>To make life easier for new members to join, I went ahead to automate the process using <a href="http://rauchg.com/slackin/">slackin</a>. Also shows how many users are online.</p>
