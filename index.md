## PrittyNote [Social application, HTML5]

Created/Updated: **April/September 13, 2014**

Link: [PrittyNote(Play Store)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prittyapp)

PrittyNote makes digital images that would be the average size of a sticky note in real life and way much more cool. At PrittyNote we call the images “prittynote(s)”. Perceive real sticky notes that you've written a joke, advice, quote, lovely message, or anything and left somewhere a friend, relative, family or people can see. With prittynote you can share to any social platform e.g. Whatsapp, facebook, twitter, tumblr, instagram etc.

## Revived Nairobi JavaScript Community

The Nairobi JavaScript Community had been created, last year and had died down towards the end of the same year.

It is now the most active community in the city if not in Kenya, and growing by the day. Other milestones achieved for the JavaScript Community are:

#### Creation of a Whatsapp Group
Currently at **94** (at the time of writing) members (threshold is 100 for whatsapp groups)

#### Meetup Group page & mailing list

## Created Nairobi JavaScript Community Slack Group
Date Created: **3rd July, 2015**

Link: [https://nairobijs.slack.com/](https://nairobijs.slack.com/)

Due to the whatsapp group limitation to 100 members we further decided a **Slack** group would serve as well as wanted all members to be able to share, communicate and fun together without the 100 members limitation imposed on whatsapp groups.

This way could also seperate discussions into topics of interest. This would seperate noise from the important information that is shared where members desired to retain them. **72** members joined up within the 1st week. Currently at **106** members at the time of writting this.

To make life easier for new members to join, I went ahead to automate the process using **[slackin](http://rauchg.com/slackin/)**. Also shows how many users are online.
